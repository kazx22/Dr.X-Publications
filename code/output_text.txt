In this era worldwide, over half of all ongoing \nmedical treatment trials are focusing on cancer treatments.7 \nEntities, such as the type of cancer, its site, and severity, guide \nto select treatment options and its progress. The most widely \nused traditional treatment methods are surgery, chemotherapy, \nand radiotherapy, while modern modalities include hormone \ntherapy, anti-angiogenic, stem cell therapies, immunotherapy, \nand dendritic cell-based immunotherapy.10\nConventional cancer therapies\nThe most recommended conventional cancer treatment strat-\negies include surgical resection of the tumors followed by \nradiotherapy with x-rays and/or chemotherapy.11 Of these \nmodalities, surgery is most effective at an early stage of dis-\nease progression. Radiation therapy can damage healthy \ncells, organs, and tissues. Although chemotherapy has \nreduced morbidity and mortality, virtually all chemothera-\npeutic agents damage healthy cells, especially rapidly divid-\ning and growing cells.12 Drug resistance, a major problem \nwith chemotherapy, is a phenomenon wherein cancer cells \nthat initially were suppressed by an anti-cancer drug develop \nresistance to the drug. This is caused primarily by reduced \ndrug uptake and increased drug efflux.13 Limitations of con-\nventional chemotherapeutic modality, such as dosage selec-\ntion difficulty, lack of specificity, rapid drug metabolism"}

The efficiency of \nconventional cancer is reduced due to tumor pathology and \narchitectural abnormality of tumor tissue blood vessels.15 \nThe following are the advanced and innovative cancer ther -\napy types with their benefits and challenges.\nStem cells therapy\nStem cells are undifferentiated cells present in the bone mar-\nrow (BM) with an ability to differentiate into any type of \nbody cell. Stem cell therapeutic strategy is also one of the \ntreatment options for cancer which are considered to be safe \nand effective. Application of stem cell is yet in the experi-\nmental clinical trial; for example, their use in the regenera-\ntion of other damaged tissue is being explored. Mesenchymal \nstem cells (MSCs) are currently being used in trials that are \ndelivered from the BM, fat tissues, and connective tissues.16\nPluripotent stem cells\nEmbryonic stem cells (ESCs) isolated from the uniform \ninner mass cells of the embryo possess the flexibility to \nadminister rise to any or all kinds of cells except those within \nthe placenta. In 2006, the invention of Yamanaka factors to \ninduce pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from physical cells in \na culture marked a breakthrough in cell biology.17 Avoiding \nethical issues from embryo destruction, iPSCs and ESCs \nhave the same characteristics. Hematopoietic embryonic \nstem cells (hESCs) and iPSCs are currently used for the \ninduction of effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells,18 \nand anti-tumor vaccine preparation.19\nAdult stem cells\nAdult stem cells (ASCs) groups often used in tumor therapy \ninclude hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), MSCs, and neural \nstem cells (NSCs). HSCs, located in BM, can form all mature \nblood cells in the body.

This mechanism is dependent \non the active interaction between stem cell CXCR4 receptors \nand requires their interaction with endothelial cells through \nLFA-1, VLA-4/5, CD44, and the secretion of matrix degra-\ndable enzyme MMP-2/9.22 The second mechanism is the \ntumor-tropic effect in which the migration of MSCs toward \ntumor microenvironment (TM) after attraction by CXCL16, \nSDF-1, CCL-25, and IL-6 secreted by tumor cells and dif-\nferentiation of MSCs within the tumor cells which contrib-\nutes to tumor stromal development.24 Stem cells also act by \nparacrine factor secretion, including extracellular vesicles \n(EVs) and soluble materials,25 and their differentiation \ncapacity, such as transplanted HSCs, can give rise to all \nblood cell types.26\nGenerally, cancer treatment using stem cell therapy by \nvarious strategies, including transplantation of HSC,27 MSC \ninfusion,28 therapeutic carriers, 29 generation of immune \neffector cells,30 and vaccine production.31 The stem cell can-\ncer therapy approach confronted the following side effects: \n(1) tumorigenesis, (2) adverse events in allogeneic HSC \ntransplantation, (3) drug toxicity and drug resistance, (4) \nincreased immune responses and autoimmunity, and (5) viral \ninfection.22 Despite several successes, there are challenges, \nsuch as therapeutic dose control, low cell targeting, and \nretention in tumor sites, that should be investigated and over-\ncome in the future.

There are various signaling mechanisms and \npathways that TM-forming cells dynamically interact with \nthe cancerous cells which are suitable for sustaining a rea-\nsonably high cellular proliferation. So, it is the area of \nresearch interest using TM conditions to mediate effective \ntargeting measures for cancer therapy.35\nSelectively treating cancer cells with conventional chem-\notherapy is difficult since it is similar to normal cells. So \nthose problems are intervened by cellular mechanisms, such \nas cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, proliferation pre-\nvention, and interfering with metabolic reprogramming by \ntargeted drug therapy agents.36 Modifying TM and targeting \nTM for drug delivery for effective treatment are two strate-\ngies that can be used for the treatment of cancer.37 Targeted \ntherapy drugs do work in different ways from standard \nchemotherapy drugs treatment like attacking cancer cells \nwhile doing less damage to normal cells which is a program-\nming that sets them apart from normal, healthy cells.38\nUsing targeted therapy markedly increased the survival \nrate for some diseases, for example, from 17% to 24% in \npatients with advanced pancreatic cancer, the addition of \nerlotinib to standard chemotherapy.

Similar to surgery, thermal ablation \nremoves the tumor and a 5\u201310 mm thick margin of seem-\ningly normal tissue but the tissue is killed in situ and then \nabsorbed by the body later. The procedure is similar to sur-\ngery using an open, laparoscopic, or endoscopic approach \nbut is commonly applied using a percutaneous or non-inva-\nsive approach.

Cryoablation uses a \nhypothermic modality to induce tissue damage by a freeze-\nthaw process against others. All these treatments operate on \nthe principle of hyperthermia except cryoablation. Of all the \nablation techniques, cryoablation demonstrated the highest \npotential to elicit a post-ablative immunogenic response.52\nRecent studies showed additional to tissue disruption \nRFA and cryoablation can modulate the immune system that \nthey were applied as therapy on TM and in the systematic \ncirculation.

Stable isotope a nalysis (SIa) and other geochemi-\ncal methods have been used extensively in food web studies and, m ore recently, to trace animal \nmovements across habitats with distinctive isotopic signatures (Hobson 1999, Boecklen et al. 2011). \nThis convergence represents a new direction for the ield of eco geochemistry, a term irst used by \nmizutani et al.

However, while stable isotopes \nhave been used in animal migration studies in terrestrial environments for several decades (Hobson \n1999, Rubenstein & Hobson 2004), the approach has received fa r less attention in marine systems \n(Fry 1981, Schell et al. 1989, Best & Schell 1996). This lack of effort may be due, at least in part, to \na failure to recognize the degree of geographic variation in is otope and element abundances across \nmarine environments (Hobson 1999, Rubenstein & Hobson 2004) . compilations of maps showing \nspatial variation in isotope values have identiied marine isoscapes that are clearly suficient for use \nin movement studies over  ocean- basin scales (west et al. 2010, mcmahon et al. 2013).\nThe use of ecogeochemical approaches to examine trophic dynamics and movement patterns \nof animals offers signiicant advantages over traditional method s in marine environments.

Physical- chemical processes governing hydro-\ngen isotope fractionation in the marine environment include eva poration, precipitation, mixing \nand exchange reactions (Friedman 1953). Evaporation from a number of sources, including clouds, \nwater bodies, soil and plant and animal respiration, forms an i mportant basis for fractionation of \nhydrogen isotopes in the hydrologic cycle. Fractionation of hydrogen isotopes during evaporation is \nlargely a kinetic process that depends on a number of factors and can, in turn, be quite large. vapour \npressures of the isotopologues of water decrease with decreas ing molecular weight; therefore, the \nheavy isotope (2H) will favour that part of the system in which it is more strongl y bound, that is, \nthe liquid phase (gat 1996). The same is true for condensation; ther efore, during evaporation and \ncondensation in an open system, the liquid phase of water becomes progressively enriched in 2H, \nwhile the vapour phase becomes progressively depleted. This p rocess is known as Rayleigh distil-\nlation (gat 1996). Rayleigh distillation has important implications for latitudinal gradients in ocean \n\u03b42H values of seawater ( \u03b42HSw) as described in the next section. Hydrogen isotope fractionat ion \nfactors for phase transitions of water are so large that even in  high- temperature systems like hydro-\nthermal vents, signiicant variation in \u03b42HSw can be seen (Horita & wesolowski 1994). Further \nfractionation of hydrogen isotopes can take place at hydrotherma l vents and  deep- water cold seeps \nduring oxidation of H2 and cH4 to H2O and cO2. The pressure (depth) at which these reactions take \nplace can also have an impact on hydrogen isotope fractionation (Horita 1999).\nHydrogen isotopes can also be fractionated"}

Rayleigh distillation is a fundamental process control-\nling latitudinal gradients in \u03b42HSw. as water vapour travels polewards and cools, some of the vapour \ncondenses out as enriched precipitation, leaving the remainin g vapour further depleted relative to \nits source. The water vapour becomes more depleted as the fraction of vapour remaining becomes \nsmaller, until it is inally deposited as highly 2 H- depleted snow at the poles.

The irst of these fractionation processes is caused by equili-\nbration of cO2 between the atmosphere and the surface ocean DIc pool (Boutton 1 991). The dis-\nsolution of cO2 in seawater occurs through the following reactions:\n CO CO H O H CO H HCO H CO2(atm) 2(aq) 2 2 2\u21cc \u21cc \u21cc \u21cc+ + + + \u2212 +\n3 3 2 2 2\u2212\nalthough the equilibration of cO 2 alone is relatively fast (approximately 1 year), exchange \nbetween atmospheric cO 2 and DIc that includes all the inorganic carbon species is a slow er pro-\ncess, on the order of about 10 years (Broecker & Peng 1974). at a t ypical surface seawater pH of \n8.2, seawater DIc has 91% bicarbonate ion, 8% carbonate ion, and 1% dissolved cO2. There is also \nsigniicant  temperature- dependent fractionation of carbon iso topes among the various dissolved \ncarbon species (Zeebe &  wolf- gladrow 2001). The \u03b413c value of cO 2(atm) is approximately \u20138\u2030 \n(Keeling et al. 2005). at 25\u00b0c, carbon isotope fractionation be tween cO2(atm) and cO2(aq) is 1.3"}

There are mixed results regarding the degree of trophic discrimination \n(\u03942H) in  non- exchangable hydrogen. Some studies report signiicant differences between diet and \nconsumer \u03b42H values, suggesting some degree of trophic fractionation (macko et al. 1983, Birchall \net al. 2005). However, other studies found that trophic fracti onation was negligible and suggested \nthat some  non- exchangeable hydrogen in consumer tissue may c ome from ingestion or diffusion \nfrom ambient water (Solomon et al. 2009).\nmarine carbon is typically thought to be conservatively fracti onated (\u039413c = 0\u2030 to 1\u2030) as it \ncontinues to move through food webs (DeNiro & Epstein 1978).

The carbon skeletons \nof different dietary components (proteins, lipids, and carb ohydrates), which are often isotopically \ndistinct from each other, can be routed to different tissue con stituents in a process termed isotopic \nrouting (Schwarcz 1991).

To control for tissue composition differences, it is often desir-\nable to analyse the same tissue type across all samples. This is n ot always possible, particularly for \nlarge food web reconstructions that may require analysing a wide range of tissues.\nanother common, although often debated, practice used to control for tissue composition differ-\nences is to normalize tissue lipid content, through either che mical extraction or mathematical cor-\nrection (Post et al. 2007, logan et al. 2008, Boecklen et al. 20 11). while the change in \u03b413c values \nwith lipid removal is expected, chemical extraction often aff ects nitrogen isotope values as well \n(Sotiropoulos et al. 2004, logan et al. 2008). given that most lipids do not contain nitrogen, these \nindings indicate that we do not fully understand the changes in tissue composition that occur during \nchemical lipid extraction. Several mathematical models have been d eveloped to correct  non- lipid \nextracted tissue isotope values for lipid contribution a posteriori  (Post et al. 2007, logan et al. \n2008). most models use elemental  carbon-  to- nitrogen ratios (c:N) of bulk tissue as a proxy for \nlipid content and a  protein- lipid \u03b413c discrimination factor (Sweeting et al. 2006, Post et al. 2007 ). \nHowever, these parameters are not well constrained and may var y among species or higher taxa, \nresulting in a large range in the predictive power of the approach (0.25 < R2 < 0.96) (Post et al. 2007, \nlogan et al. 2008, Tarroux et al. 2010).\nNitrogen isotopes typically exhibit a 3\u2030 to 4\u2030 trophic discrimination (\u039415N) between diet and \nconsumer (DeNiro & Epstein 1981, minagawa & wada 1984).

{"file": "Stats.docx", "source": "docx", "chunk": 0, "text": "Introduction\nThe purpose of the Machine Readable file (\u201cthe file\u201d) is to provide regression coefficients and intercepts for different components to calculate low, mid, and high (10th, 50th, and 90th percentile) material price estimates and labor multipliers/add-ons to estimate new construction and retrofit project costs. The file provides a list of envelope and non-envelope components (e.g., Windows, Water Heaters) and any associated classes within those components (e.g., Low Emissivity, Electric Instantaneous). \nMaterial Price Regression\nThe Component & Class portion of the file shows the component, the class, and the output units. The \u201coutput units\u201d column describes what the units of final output of the regression will be (e.g., 2023$, 2023$/sqft).\n\n\nThe second and third sections of the file (Retail Price Regression) show the \u201cCoefficient-Low\u201d, \u201cCoefficient-Mid\u201d, and \u201cCoefficient-High\u201d values that correspond to the low, mid, and high quantile regression coefficients that are used to multiply the chosen performance metric values. These sections also contain the name and units of each performance metric and the associated unit and the lower and upper bounds of the regression. Each component is fitted via quantile regression to one (e.g., clothes dryers) or two (e.g., water heaters) applicable performance metrics. Some components, such as thermostats, have no regression analysis as there is no measurable performance metric associated with the product. The performance metrics were chosen based on market research on pricing factors and customer needs. Some components do not have any performance metrics because there were no significant component differentiators beyond the class types. The Retail Price Regression section of the file also contains the intercepts for the quantile regression equations.  \n\n\n\n\n\nLabor and Installed Cost\nThe total installed cost is calculated one of two ways depending on the component. The first method is using an installation multiplier to derive the total installed cost based on the material price. The labor multipliers are separated out by \u201cscenario\u201d (new construction or retrofit). Retrofit scenarios include costs for removal or other demolition of existing components. After getting the estimated material price from calculating the material price regression using the coefficients, intercepts, and chosen performance metric input values, the multiplier is used to calculate the total installed cost or cost per square foot. The material and equipment price must be calculated first in order to use the labor cost multipliers. See Example 1.\nThe second"}
====================
{"file": "Stats.docx", "source": "docx", "chunk": 1, "text": " method to calculate the total installed cost is by using adders rather than multipliers. Labor for some of the components does not scale with increasing material or equipment price and has a constant installation cost (i.e., certain types of insulation upgrades). The values are therefore added to the material price regression results to produce the total installed cost or cost per square foot. See Example 2.\n\n\nNote for certain technologies with recent standards activity and data availability the installation costs are derived from the Technical Support Documents for the given appliance and averaged to create an installation adder. For technologies that do not have recent standards data available, installation costs were derived using a variety of available resources including RSMeans. For example, Heat Pump Water Heaters and other products covered under appliance standards rely on the updated appliance standards data to derive the installation costs. \nAdditional Data\nThe last section of the file contains additional data not directly within the calculation of each component and product class. These include the expected lifetime (in years) of the component, cost variation considerations, a list of data sources used in the analysis for each component (using a numbering format), and a qualitative confidence rating of the data. \nFor cost variation considerations, the following implications may have additional impacts on pricing for each component. \nPrevailing local wages\nDrive time\nAccess\nPresence/condition/type of existing insulation\nExisting construction and materials\nMoisture issues present\nCondition of existing flue\nNeed for condensate line/drain\nNeed to bring in combustion air\nCondition of existing electrical system\nPresence of hazardous materials\nNature/size of leaks\nExtent of preparation\nEach regression was given a confidence rating in the categories of sample size (SS), median  (R2), and source diversity, to qualify how robust the data and corresponding regressions are. If a dataset had a sample size above 100 data points, it was marked as \"High SS\". If it had between 50 and 100 data points, it was marked as \"Medium SS\", and less than 50 corresponds to \"Low SS\". If the regression plot had a median  over 0.4, it is marked as \"High R2\". If it is between 0.4 and 0.1, it is marked as \"Medium R2\", and if lower than 0.1, it is marked as \"Low R2\". For source diversity, if the data set uses over two (2) different sources, it is \"High Source"}
====================
{"file": "Stats.docx", "source": "docx", "chunk": 2, "text": " Diversity\". If there are only two (2) sources, it is \"Medium Source Diversity\", and if the data just comes from one (1) source then it is marked as \"Low Source Diversity\". \u201cNo clear sources\u201d refers to cases where the source material was not marked for the component. For complete list of data sources utilized, see Data Sources tab within the file.\n\nPrice Calculation Example\nExample 1: Air Source Heat Pump (Retrofit Installation Multiplier)\nExample for calculating the low, mid, and high retail price along with the associated labor for replacing an air source heat pump that does not require a new circuit or panel upgrade. The numbers in red correspond to the different coefficients in the flat CSV file for the two performance metrics and the low, mid, and high regressions:\n\nWhere A is the capacity in tons, B is the efficiency in SEER1, and C is the intercept value (constant). \n\n\n\n\nTo produce the total installed cost, use the retrofit labor multiplier (if this was for new construction, the new construction multiplier would be used):\n\n\n\nTherefore, the median material price is $9,826 and the labor cost is $4,913 for a total installed cost of $20,635. The installation costs here include labor and equipment costs for demolition, removal, and installation. There are many reasons the price for a specific home could be higher or lower, some of which are mentioned in the Cost Variation Considerations column. Note in this example the labor cost is calculated by subtracting the material price from the installed cost.\nExample 2 Unfinished Attic Ceiling Batt Insulation (Retrofit Installation Adder)\nExample for calculating the low, mid, and high retail price along with the associated labor for replacing (retrofitting) ceiling insulation in an unfinished attic with an R-Value of 15, using fiberglass batt insulation. The numbers in red correspond to the different coefficients in the Machine Readable CSV file for the performance metric and the low, mid, and high regressions:\n\nWhere A is the R-value coefficient and C is the intercept value (constant). \n\n\n\n\nTo produce the total installed cost, use the retrofit labor adder, (if this was for new construction, the new construction adder would be used):\n\n\n\nTherefore, the median material price is $0.86 per square foot and the labor cost is $1.00 per square foot for a total installed cost of $1.86 per square foot. \n"}

A bookseller in the northeast corner of\nthe country told me that only one person purchased a copy the first\nweek of its release. It took another six months for the bookseller to\nunload a second copy\u2014and that was to the same person who\nbought the first! And who knows how long it took to sell the third.\nBy the end of the year, it was clear to everyone that The Alchemist\nwasn\u2019t working. My original publisher decided to cut me loose and\ncancelled our contract. They wiped their hands of the project and let\nme take the book with me. I was forty-one and desperate.\nBut I never lost faith in the book or ever wavered in my vision.\nWhy? Because it was me in there, all of me, heart and soul. I was\nliving my own metaphor. A man sets out on a journey, dreaming of a\nbeautiful or magical place, in pursuit of some unknown treasure. At\nthe end of his journey, the man realizes the treasure was with him\nthe entire time. I was following my Personal Legend, and my\ntreasure was my capacity to write. And I wanted to share this\ntreasure with the world.\nAs I wrote in The Alchemist, when you want something, the whole\nuniverse conspires to help you. I started knocking on the doors of\nother publishers. One opened, and the publisher on the other side\nbelieved in me and my book and agreed to give The Alchemist a\nsecond chance. Slowly, through word of mouth, it finally started to\nsell\u2014three thousand, then six thousand, ten thousand\u2014book by\nbook, gradually throughout the year.\nEight months later, an American visiting Brazil picked up a copy of\nThe Alchemist in a local bookstore. He wanted to translate the book\nand help me find a publisher in the United States. HarperCollins\nagreed to bring it to an American audience, publishing it with great\nfanfare: ads in the New York Times and influential news magazines,"}

Then Madonna\nraved about the book to Vanity Fair, and people from different walks\nof life\u2014from Rush Limbaugh and Will Smith to college students and\nsoccer moms\u2014were suddenly talking about it.\nThe Alchemist became a spontaneous\u2014and organic\u2014\nPhenomenon. The book hit the New York Times bestseller list, an\nimportant milestone for any author, and stayed there for more than\nthree hundred weeks. It has since been translated into more than\neighty different languages, the most translated book by any living\nauthor, and is widely considered one of the ten best books of the\ntwentieth century.\nPeople continue to ask me if I knew The Alchemist would be such\na huge success. The answer is no. I had no idea. How could I?\nWhen I sat down to write The Alchemist, all I knew is that I wanted to\nwrite about my soul. I wanted to write about my quest to find my\ntreasure. I wanted to follow the omens, because I knew even then\nthat the omens are the language of God.\nThough The Alchemist is now celebrating its twenty-fifth\nanniversary, it is no relic of the past. The book is still very much\nalive. Like my heart and like my soul, it continues to live every day,\nbecause my heart and soul are in it. And my heart and soul is your\nheart and soul.

He was so\nfascinated by himself that, one morning, he fell into the lake and\ndrowned. At the spot where he fell, a flower was born, which was\ncalled the narcissus.\nBut this was not how the author of the book ended the story.\nHe said that when Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest\nappeared and found the lake, which had been fresh water,\ntransformed into a lake of salty tears.\n\u201cWhy do you weep?\u201d the goddesses asked.\n\u201cI weep for Narcissus,\u201d the lake replied.\n\u201cAh, it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus,\u201d they said, \u201cfor\nthough we always pursued him in the forest, you alone could\ncontemplate his beauty close at hand.\u201d\n\u201cBut . . . was Narcissus beautiful?\u201d the lake asked.\n\u201cWho better than you to know that?\u201d the goddesses said in\nwonder. \u201cAfter all, it was by your banks that he knelt each day to\ncontemplate himself!\u201d\nThe lake was silent for some time. Finally, it said:\n\u201cI weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was\nbeautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I\ncould see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a lovely story,\u201d the alchemist thought."}

He saw to it that all the\nsheep entered through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks\nacross it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night.\nThere were no wolves in the region, but once an animal had strayed\nduring the night, and the boy had had to spend the entire next day\nsearching for it.\nHe swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he\nhad just finished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would\nhave to start reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made\nmore comfortable pillows.\nIt was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the\nstars through the half-destroyed roof.\nI wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same\ndream that night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened\nbefore it ended.\nHe arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep\nthat still slept. He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his\nanimals also began to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy\nbound his life to that of the sheep, with whom he had spent the past\ntwo years, leading them through the countryside in search of food\nand water. \u201cThey are so used to me that they know my schedule,\u201d he\nmuttered.

Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he\nhad seen in the villages they passed.\nBut for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one\nthing: the girl, the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village\nthey would reach in about four days. He had been to the village only\nonce, the year before. The merchant was the proprietor of a dry\ngoods shop, and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in\nhis presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the\nboy about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there.\n\u201cI need to sell some wool,\u201d the boy told the merchant.\nThe shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait until\nthe afternoon.

The shepherd told her of the\nAndalusian countryside, and related the news from the other towns\nwhere he had stopped. It was a pleasant change from talking to his\nsheep.\n\u201cHow did you learn to read?\u201d the girl asked at one point.\n\u201cLike everybody learns,\u201d he said. \u201cIn school.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?\u201d\nThe boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid\nresponding to her question. He was sure the girl would never\nunderstand. He went on telling stories about his travels, and her\nbright, Moorish eyes went wide with fear and surprise. As the time\npassed, the boy found himself wishing that the day would never end,\nthat her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days.\nHe recognized that he was feeling something he had never\nexperienced before: the desire to live in one place forever.

Yes, their days were all the same, with the\nseemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had\nnever read a book in their young lives, and didn\u2019t understand when\nthe boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content\nwith just food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of\ntheir wool, their company, and\u2014once in a while\u2014their meat.\nIf I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by one,\nthey would become aware only after most of the flock had been\nslaughtered, thought the boy.

It was there that the wise man lived.\n\u201cRather than finding a saintly man, though, our hero, on entering\nthe main room of the castle, saw a hive of activity: tradesmen came\nand went, people were conversing in the corners, a small orchestra\nwas playing soft music, and there was a table covered with platters\nof the most delicious food in that part of the world. The wise man\nconversed with everyone, and the boy had to wait for two hours\nbefore it was his turn to be given the man\u2019s attention.\n\u201cThe wise man listened attentively to the boy\u2019s explanation of why\nhe had come, but told him that he didn\u2019t have time just then to\nexplain the secret of happiness. He suggested that the boy look\naround the palace and return in two hours.\n\u201c\u2018Meanwhile, I want to ask you to do something,\u2019 said the wise\nman, handing the boy a teaspoon that held two drops of oil. \u2018As you\nwander around, carry this spoon with you without allowing the oil to\nspill.\u2019\n\u201cThe boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of\nthe palace, keeping his eyes fixed on the spoon. After two hours, he\nreturned to the room where the wise man was.\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 asked the wise man, \u2018did you see the Persian tapestries\nthat are hanging in my dining hall? Did you see the garden that it\ntook the master gardener ten years to create? Did you notice the\nbeautiful parchments in my library?\u2019\n\u201cThe boy was embarrassed, and confessed that he had observed\nnothing. His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise\nman had entrusted to him.\n\u201c\u2018Then go back and observe the marvels of my world,\u2019 said the\nwise man. \u2018You cannot trust a man if you don\u2019t know his"}

Now everything was quite different from\nhow it was that day they had set out: then, there had been confusion\nand shouting, the cries of children and the whinnying of animals, all\nmixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants.\nBut, in the desert, there was only the sound of the eternal wind,\nand of the hoofbeats of the animals. Even the guides spoke very little\nto one another.\n\u201cI\u2019ve crossed these sands many times,\u201d said one of the camel\ndrivers one night. \u201cBut the desert is so huge, and the horizons so\ndistant, that they make a person feel small, and as if he should\nremain silent.\u201d\nThe boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without ever\nhaving set foot in the desert before.

If the\nsand was too fine for the animals\u2019 hooves, they sought a way where\nthe sand was more substantial. In some places, the ground was\ncovered with the salt of dried-up lakes.

There were three hundred wells, fifty thousand date trees,\nand innumerable colored tents spread among them.\n\u201cIt looks like A Thousand and One Nights,\u201d said the Englishman,\nimpatient to meet with the alchemist.\nThey were surrounded by children, curious to look at the animals\nand people that were arriving. The men of the oasis wanted to know\nif they had seen any fighting, and the women competed with one\nanother for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the\nmerchants. The silence of the desert was a distant dream; the\ntravelers in the caravan were talking incessantly, laughing and\nshouting, as if they had emerged from the spiritual world and found\nthemselves once again in the world of people. They were relieved\nand happy.\nThey had been taking careful precautions in the desert, but the\ncamel driver explained to the boy that oases were always considered\nto be neutral territories, because the majority of the inhabitants were\nwomen and children. There were oases throughout the desert, but\nthe tribesmen fought in the desert, leaving the oases as places of\nrefuge.\nWith some difficulty, the leader of the caravan brought all his\npeople together and gave them his instructions. The group was to\nremain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was\nover. Since they were visitors, they would have to share living space\nwith those who lived there, and would be given the best\naccommodations. That was the law of hospitality. Then he asked that\neveryone, including his own sentinels, hand over their arms to the\nmen appointed by the tribal chieftains.\n\u201cThose are the rules of war,\u201d the leader explained. \u201cThe oases\nmay not shelter armies or troops.\u201d\nTo the boy\u2019s surprise, the Englishman took a chrome-plated\nrevolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting\nthe arms."}

The closer he got\nto the realization of his dream, the more difficult things became. It\nseemed as if what the old king had called \u201cbeginner\u2019s luck\u201d were no\nlonger functioning. In his pursuit of the dream, he was being\nconstantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage. So he\ncould not be hasty, nor impatient. If he pushed forward impulsively,\nhe would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path.\nGod placed them along my path. He had surprised himself with\nthe thought. Until then, he had considered the omens to be things of\nthis world. Like eating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a\njob. He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by\nGod to indicate what he should do.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be impatient,\u201d he repeated to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s like the camel\ndriver said: \u2018Eat when it\u2019s time to eat. And move along when it\u2019s time\nto move along.\u2019\u201d\nThat first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the\nEnglishman. The boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a\ntent with five other young men of about his age. They were people of\nthe desert, and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities.\nThe boy told them about his life as a shepherd, and was about to\ntell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman\ncame into the tent.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you all morning,\u201d he said, as he led the boy\noutside. \u201cI need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives.\u201d\nFirst, they tried to find him on their own. An alchemist would\nprobably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of\nthe people at the oasis, and it was likely that in his tent an oven was\ncontinuously burning. They searched everywhere, and found that the\noasis was much larger than they could have imagined; there were\nhundreds of tents."}

He was more certain of it than of\nanything in the world. He had been told by his parents and\ngrandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person\nbefore becoming committed.

Because, when you know\nthat language, it\u2019s easy to understand that someone in the world\nawaits you, whether it\u2019s in the middle of the desert or in some great\ncity.

The ground was covered with the most beautiful\ncarpets he had ever walked upon, and from the top of the structure\nhung lamps of handwrought gold, each with a lighted candle. The\ntribal chieftains were seated at the back of the tent in a semicircle,\nresting upon richly embroidered silk cushions. Servants came and\nwent with silver trays laden with spices and tea. Other servants\nmaintained the fires in the hookahs. The atmosphere was suffused\nwith the sweet scent of smoke.\nThere were eight chieftains, but the boy could see immediately\nwhich of them was the most important: an Arab dressed in white and\ngold, seated at the center of the semicircle. At his side was the\nyoung Arab the boy had spoken with earlier.\n\u201cWho is this stranger who speaks of omens?\u201d asked one of the\nchieftains, eyeing the boy.\n\u201cIt is I,\u201d the boy answered. And he told what he had seen."}

No one attacks an oasis,\u201d said a\nthird chieftain.\n\u201cI can only tell you what I saw. If you don\u2019t want to believe me, you\ndon\u2019t have to do anything about it.\u201d\nThe men fell into an animated discussion. They spoke in an\nArabic dialect that the boy didn\u2019t understand, but, when he made to\nleave, the guard told him to stay. The boy became fearful; the omens\ntold him that something was wrong. He regretted having spoken to\nthe camel driver about what he had seen in the desert.\nSuddenly, the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly, and\nthe boy felt better. The man hadn\u2019t participated in the discussion,\nand, in fact, hadn\u2019t said a word up to that point. But the boy was\nalready used to the Language of the World, and he could feel the\nvibrations of peace throughout the tent. Now his intuition was that he\nhad been right in coming.\nThe discussion ended. The chieftains were silent for a few\nmoments as they listened to what the old man was saying. Then he\nturned to the boy: this time his expression was cold and distant.\n\u201cTwo thousand years ago, in a distant land, a man who believed in\ndreams was thrown into a dungeon and then sold as a slave,\u201d the old\nman said, now in the dialect the boy understood. \u201cOur merchants\nbought that man, and brought him to Egypt. All of us know that\nwhoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them.\u201d\nThe elder continued, \u201cWhen the pharaoh dreamed of cows that\nwere thin and cows that were fat, this man I\u2019m speaking of rescued\nEgypt from famine. His name was Joseph. He, too, was a stranger in\na strange land, like you, and he was probably about your age.\u201d\nHe paused, and his eyes were still unfriendly."}

Everything we know was taught to us by the desert.\u201d\nThe old man gave a signal, and everyone stood. The meeting was\nover. The hookahs were extinguished, and the guards stood at\nattention.

There was enough there\nto buy a lot of weapons.\n\u201cWhat is an alchemist?\u201d he asked, finally.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a man who understands nature and the world. If he wanted to,\nhe could destroy this camp just with the force of the wind.\u201d\nThe men laughed. They were used to the ravages of war, and\nknew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow. Yet each felt\nhis heart beat a bit faster. They were men of the desert, and they\nwere fearful of sorcerers.\n\u201cI want to see him do it,\u201d said the chief.\n\u201cHe needs three days,\u201d answered the alchemist. \u201cHe is going to\ntransform himself into the wind, just to demonstrate his powers.

There were mountains in the\ndistance. And there were dunes, rocks, and plants that insisted on\nliving where survival seemed impossible. There was the desert that\nhe had wandered for so many months; despite all that time, he knew\nonly a small part of it. Within that small part, he had found an\nEnglishman, caravans, tribal wars, and an oasis with fifty thousand\npalm trees and three hundred wells.\n\u201cWhat do you want here today?\u201d the desert asked him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you\nspend enough time looking at me yesterday?\u201d\n\u201cSomewhere you are holding the person I love,\u201d the boy said. \u201cSo,\nwhen I look out over your sands, I am also looking at her.

He knows\nyour rocks, your dunes, and your mountains, and you are generous\nto him.\u201d\n\u201cThe falcon\u2019s beak carries bits of me, myself,\u201d the desert said. \u201cFor\nyears, I care for his game, feeding it with the little water that I have,\nand then I show him where the game is.

That\u2019s how the world goes.\u201d\n\u201cSo is that what love is?\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s what love is.

It knew of the\nboy\u2019s talk with the desert, because the winds know everything. They\nblow across the world without a birthplace, and with no place to die.\n\u201cHelp me,\u201d the boy said. \u201cOne day you carried the voice of my\nloved one to me.\u201d\n\u201cWho taught you to speak the language of the desert and the\nwind?\u201d\n\u201cMy heart,\u201d the boy answered.\nThe wind has many names. In that part of the world, it was called\nthe sirocco, because it brought moisture from the oceans to the east.\nIn the distant land the boy came from, they called it the levanter,\nbecause they believed that it brought with it the sands of the desert,\nand the screams of the Moorish wars. Perhaps, in the places beyond\nthe pastures where his sheep lived, men thought that the wind came\nfrom Andalusia.

The dimensions would thus have been measured out from the north-eastern area of the \nplateau, southwards and westwards towards the Second and Third Pyramids. The task of setting \nout the plan would have been no more difficult in principle than laying out the base of a single \npyramid, and it will be noted that the components of spacing between the three pyramids are in \neach case shorter than the side-length of the Great Pyramid. \nBefore the extensive quarrying of the rock for building stone took  place, the natural \nsurface of the Giza plateau had a general slope of around 5 degrees, and the projection onto \nthe horizontal plane of a measurement taken over the surface would have been reduced by \nabout 0.4%. Thus the dimensions of the site plan could have been laid out with reasonable  \naccuracy without correcting for the slope of the plateau. Once the approximate position for \neach pyramid had been determined, however, the sites were leveled around the perimeter, \nand may also have been connected by temporary horizontal-topped embankments so that \nthe east-west and north-south components of spacing between the three pyramid bases \ncould be laid down with the greatest accuracy. While ropes may have been used in the \ninitial marking out of the site plan, the observed accuracy in the finished dimensions was \nprobably achieved  through the use of pairs of butting measuring rods laid alternately end \nover end \u2013 a method capable of achieving a high degree of precision.16 \n \nThe Great Pyramid \nIt is generally accepted that the sides of the Great Pyramid measure 440 cubits, although \nonly the longest or south side has exactly this length according to the survey by Cole.17  In \nterms of the Giza royal cubit of 0.52375 metres or 20.620 inches, the actual mean side of \n230.364 metres corresponds to 439.8 cubits, with an average variation in the sides of only 6 \ncm or 0.1 cubit. Petrie suggested that an adjustment had been effected such that the \nperimeter of the base would express the 'pi-proportion' in relation to the height of 280 \ncubits, with greater accuracy than the value for \u03c0 of 22/7.18 In this case, the theoretical side-\nlength will be  (140 \u00d7 \u03c0) or 439.822... cub"}

Taking further distances along the north-south axis, the impression of a \ndeliberate design is strongly supported. The distance southwards from the north side of the \nGreat Pyramid to the south side of the Second Pyramid is 1101 cubits, or only 0.1% greater \nthan the round-figure of 1100 cubits. This is just 2\u00bd times the side of the Great Pyramid of \n440 cubits, and the south sides of the two pyramids are separated by an axial distance from \nnorth to south of about 3/2 \u00d7 440 or 660 cubits.  \nFrom these plausible formative dimensions of 440 and 250 cubits, we can now obtain a \nprovisional design-value for the side-length of the Second Pyramid as follows: \n \nNominal  Side-length of Second Pyramid = 440 \u00d7 3/2 - 250 = 410 cubits \n \nI have termed this the nominal side-length of the Second Pyramid, because Petrie's survey-\ndata gives an actual mean side of of 8474.9 inches or exactly 411 cubits. The average \nvariation in the sides from their mean length is only 1.5 inches or 4 cm. Thus although the \nabove derivation accounts for a dimension of about 410 cubits in preference to one of just \n400 cubits, an adjustment of one cubit appears to have been made to the actual side-length. \nReasons for this adjustment will be given shortly. \nNow taking dimensions along the east-west axis, Petrie's data places the west side of the \nSecond Pyramid 624 cubits westwards from the west side of the Great Pyramid. Again with \nan adjustment of one cubit, therefore, this dimension may be equated with a nominal value of \n2\u00bd \u00d7 250 or 625 cubits, making it analogous to the distance of 2\u00bd \u00d7 440 or 1100 cubits along \nthe north-south axis. Hence the side-length of the Second Pyramid and the position relative to \nthe Great Pyramid may be ascribed to a simple design based upon modules of 440 and 250 "}

The question therefore arises as to why \nthe east-west overall dimension diverges from the value of 1000\u221a2 or 1414.2 cubits by \nabout three cubits. That this is not an error is initially indicated by the fact that the axial \ncomponent of 353.5 cubits westwards from the Second Pyramid to the west side of the \nThird Pyramid has the value of 250\u221a2 cubits:  \n250\u221a2 = 353.55... cubits \nThus this dimension is accurately one-quarter of the ideal overall dimension on the same \naxis. It is the length of the diagonal in the modular layout squares of 250 cubits, which define \nthe north-south spacing between the Second and Great Pyramids and the dimension of about \n2\u00bd \u00d7 250 or 625 cubits on the east-west axis. Adding this element of 353.5 cubits  to the \ndistances as already defined in our initial modular scheme along the east-west axis gives an \noverall east-west dimension of (440 + 625 + 353.5) equals 1418.5 cubits, which is more than \n4 cubits greater than the value of 1000\u221a2 cubits. Thus the subtraction of one cubit from the \ncomponent of 2\u00bd \u00d7 250 or 625 cubits may be seen as a judicious adjustment which improved \nthe accuracy of the square-root value in the overall dimension, without unduly undermining \nthe integrity of the modular scheme. This adjustment, furthermore, was balanced by the \naddition of one cubit to the modular dimension of 2\u00bd \u00d7 440 or 1100 cubits, to satisfy the    \nfundamental division of the overall dimension at the south side of the Second Pyramid. \nThe mathematical import"}

The evidence for the usage of these pyramids \nas tombs by certain kings of the Fourth Dynasty, on the other hand, is secondary and superficial, \nand could be explained by the appropriation of pre-existing monuments. The Giza layout provides \ncompelling evidence in support of the claim which is made in the Osirian Scripts,20 to the effect \nthat the three pyramids were constructed as a centre for the initiation of priest-neophytes into the \noccult wisdom of ancient Egypt, some thousands of years before the founding of the historical \nFirst Dynasty. \n \nNeedless to say, the notion that the Giza pyramids and temples could predate the Fourth Dynasty is \nunlikely to find many supporters in orthodox circles, but is nonetheless worthy of consideration in \nthe view of the present writer.. The fact that the name of Khufu is found written on the internal \nmasonry of the Great Pyramid in no way invalidates this possibility, since it is obvious that a king \nwho wished to claim ownership of the monument would have been obliged to adopt the name of \nthe original builder as his own, in order to avoid the need to erase the name from the fabric of the \npyramid  \u2013 an  impossible task. \n \nThe historical Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty would not, however, have wanted to be remembered as \nthe appropriator of the Great Pyramid, but rather as the builder, and to this end it is conceivable \nthat he required the population of Egypt to contribute stones towards its construction. Garbled \nreferences to this state of affairs may be found in the history of Herodotus, who tells us that Khufu \nplunged into all manner of wickedness.  He closed the temples, forbade the Egyptians from \nmaking offerings to the gods, and instead compelled them to labour one and all in his service.21  \nHe  raised money by prostituting his own daughter, who being bent on leaving a monument which \nwould perpetuate her own memory, required each man to make her a present of a stone towards the \nworks which she contemplated..
